Do you love breakfast? I love breakfast and Original Pancake House serves a mean breakfast.   I prefer the Anaheim location, but the Yorba Linda one is much larger and newer (not to mention handicap friendly, unlike the…

I went here for breakfast for the first time and I really enjoyed it. The place smells like fresh baked pies and cookies. I knew that they would have yummy home cooked meals on their menu. So i ordered a spinach omelete…

I love Mimi's Cafe.  They are so great here.  The food is good and the service is nice.  But what is so great is the ambiance.  Whenever the family was getting together, we would always meet at Mimis.  This was my…

If you've tried one, you've tried them all. But I like El Torito's Carne Asada, and the tableside guacamole is fabulous.   The service here is ridiculous however.  And I mean that in a bad way.  You would think in this…

I love eating their buttermilk pancakes with just banana and cream. A little syrup here and again. Service is great but there's usually a line. Parking can be tough sometimes. Thankfully my dad's workshop is just at the…

The restaurant has alot of seating (definitely more than the Original Pancake House in Yorba Linda) and still the wait for lunchtime was about 20 minutes. They certainly are very busy on a daily basis. The immediate…

I was very pleased with my breakfast of chorizo/egg tacos and hasbrowns.  The only thing I would improve would be the beans.  They were dry and I would recommend that they put some sauce on them.

Why 5 stars? Because Katella Grill is exactly, perfectly, what it ought to be. It's not the best food in the world, nor should it be. It's diner food, prepared carefully, consistently, and priced appropriately.   After a…
