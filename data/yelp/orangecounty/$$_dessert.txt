I'm a big fan of any place that has Guiness on tap, but this Irish pub has a lot more.    The fish n chips is fantastic, and wifey loved the spinach salad with chicken and goat cheese.  The appetizers are great too.…

The best default  Seriously, this place never disappoints.  I'll start with the negative, because there's really only one and that's wait time.  Since it's so close to the Disneyland Resort, if you hit this place up on…
