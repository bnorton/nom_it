The Briar is a great place to catch a midweek drink, lunch, or even  a spot of dinner. They do one of the best veggie wraps (lunch) around. I'm not a fan of the place on weekend nights, it's full of students and loud…

Decent Irish pub with the standard bar food and, thankfully, an above-average draft list including nitros.  My bro and I split the clam chowder which was quite tasty and actually had some tart notes that make it stand…

I've never had a problem here. I've only ordered one thing though. The sesame beef is delicious and always piping hot when delivered. I wish I could say so much about their crab rangoon. Stay away from those!

It seems to me that Ozzies Pizza is getting a bit of a bad rap here. The food may not be that fancy, but really: This is a very cheap pizza place that makes decent pizza, and these one-star reviews that I'm seeing here…
