Cool kats check in here.  Most of the reviews here on Yelp seem to be from folks who happened to be staying at the hotel, or found themselves at Scullers by chance.  Scullers is my favorite room.  Best to hear good music…

My new favorite cocktail bar in Boston, since the unfortunate passing of MATCH.  Their "Cool Hand Cuke" is absolutely delicious, and they have quite a variety of interesting mixed drinks. The decor and atmosphere is dim…

My family came to visit last week and in our wandering, we happened upon the Beehive right when we were getting hungry. I'd heard good things about it - so I was glad we had the chance to try it out.  The hosts welcomed…

I usually steer toward a more chilled out local environment with a subtle elegance, and this place is much more over the top, but it delivers every time.   The décor is pretty and stylish, and there are enough varieties…

The last time I wrote a Yelp review, Kendall Square was but a wee glimmer in a foodie's eye - a place where unsettling amounts of radio waves actually microwaved your Trade Joe's burrito for you.   Holy gentrification…

I still love going to this place.. it's a classy establishment that was pretty crowded even on a Wednesday night.  They have a Sinatra band there playing on alternate Wednesday.. same one that plays at Lucky's Lounge.…

I ate at this restaurant on the night of the last Boston Music Awards, with my best Romanian homegirl.  I should've reviewed sooner after the dining experience, but being at the hotel for a trunk show today reminded me I…

So being 30 years old and engaged, I have been out of the club scene for some 3+ years now. When I found out I would be spending a buddy's 30th birthday at a place called District in Boston, I rushed online to search for…

This is a delightful restaurant with a slight sports bar accent. Not sure why it's not ranking higher. The wait service was helpful and polite.  The location in the Hilton Hotel does not distract the pub goer looking to…

Ordered a Manhattan, bartender looked like I was speaking another language. She forgot the bitters and used the wrong vermouth. OK, maybe my fault for ordering a cocktail at a bar like this.  The venue is nice, but the…
