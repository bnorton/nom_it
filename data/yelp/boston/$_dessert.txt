This place is awesome! I've came here a few times with my friend because she and I both really like Chinese food. I'm sorta sad to say that I've only discovered this place a few months ago but as long as I know now.  The…

It's extremely difficult to give a convenience store a 5-star score based solely on their pizza, but in the end it is the pizza that everyone comes back for. I have to admit, they do make great pizza.  As for toppings,…

This place is really good and you never wait more than 10 minutes if you pick up yourself. The food is cheap, delicious and the people who run it are real nice guys. And seriously, don't call the delivery service slow…

I read another yelpers review on Caprese. I thought I should try since they were mostly positive and the pizza was inexpensive. I LOVE THIS PLACE! The pizza was perfect, flavorful with each bite, crust not to doughy.…

This place is so cute from the outside and I drive by it daily, so I wanted to try it. Well, it was just ok. The service was weird, was I supposed to go to the counter though I was sitting in a table, Im still not sure.…

My husband and I moved just around the corner from this place and I've now been three times. Service is a tad slow but the food is great. I haven't had a bad meal yet. Will definitely make this one of the regular spots.

After a disastrous meal from Kee Kar Lau last Sunday night, we ordered additional dishes from this place.   The shrimp dish was as it was supposed to be--the shrimp were succulent and tender, and the sauce was just…

To all the ihop naysayers I have a few questions:  How you gonna hate on pancakes? Where else are you going to find 4 types of syrup?  Where else are you gonna get service with a smile at 4 in the morning while drunk off…

I've been ordering from Noodle Stix a good mount recently, since I'm working 9-5 and am often too lazy to cook when I get home from work.  New discoveries: The all day combinations are excellent, lots of food for very…

I'm a scallion pancake fanatic (I know I sound really cool) and I have tried all the other Chinese places on Washington st and Dragon Chef has the best.  Great late night snack or pick up an order, walk to Joeys and have…

Decent food (your basic collegiate takeout) but what makes it great is just how nice the owners and their son are.  The prices are quite reasonable and the service is super quick, even on busy 'game' nights.  The thing…

Had to give it a Yelp 3 star but it probably falls right in the 2.5 range out of 5. On a normal day at a normal time, i'd choose plenty of other places over Pizza Days. However, they are open very late, and at that time…

Katie M hits it on the head.  "Definitely not the best pizza in the world. But it's the best of its genre - late night/snack"  Place is open until FOUR am. It's here or 7-11. Your call.  The pizza is not as greasy as,…

Here's the deal with Red House- If the food is freshly prepared-its pretty good. If it's been sitting around for a while it's gross. Now my wife loves this place and the past 4-5 times I've ordered I've noticed a vast…
