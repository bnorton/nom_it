My one visit was good. Service was a bit indifferent, but not bad in any way. I was there in the middle of a slow afternoon.  The sandwich I ordered was gorgeous. I posted a picture on Yelp, because it looked so good on…

We decided to give this place a shot on New Years Day and were pleased to find a new local establishment quite busy.  Food - I'll give it a 4 - 3 for quality and 5 for price. I got the seafood boil, and while it would…

The margarita pizza is one of my favorites. We also have great service every time we are in. On a recent visit, we ordered mussels, which can be hit or miss...these were a hit! Perfectly cooked and a little spicy. I also…

Decent Irish pub with the standard bar food and, thankfully, an above-average draft list including nitros.  My bro and I split the clam chowder which was quite tasty and actually had some tart notes that make it stand…

The Stockyard is "just ok."  Nothing thrilling, but also nothing that completely turns me off... just ok.  The convenience of this place is definitely a big plus, for me anyway.  I work at the radio station right down…

The food here is very fresh! I almost always get the Sashimi Regular. In my opinion the quality of the fish meets (if not exceeds) what you will find in any other sushi bar in Cambridge or Boston.  More "traditional"…

This is really your only choice in Malden for properly cooked wings. After all, most pizza places and even most sports bars aren't in the wing business, so they reach into the bag of frozen, freezer-burned wings,…
