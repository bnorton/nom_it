Loved it! As we walked up to look at the menu, the hostess opened the door and greeted us. We were seated right away. The menu isn't your typical Italian fare which had me worried since we aren't the fanciest of eaters…

The worst part about Met Back Bay is the difficult decision of choosing a meal. Everything on the menu sounds incredible, particularly the brunch menu.   The food looks just as amazing as it sounds too. I had the turkey…
