I don't order chocolate related items here but my favorite is their BB Julep.   Blackberries, mint and Evan Williams Honey Bourbon.  If you are a fan of juleps, this is a dessert version. Muddle blackberries give this…

I loved this place! OK I`m a little late on reviewing it  (came to D.C. on a business trip in September), but found Russia House very memorable! Right down the street in Dupont Circle, my fellow nurse friends and I…

My wife and I came to Lima for a dinner on Friday. We decided to sit at the bar and it was the right decision. Peter, the bartender, made us wonderful drinks. He also made us feel comfortable. We ordered the food Peter…

My experience at Buddha Bar was for dinner and while I can see where some of the other reviewers are coming from in terms of the clientele, I had a great time.  The ambiance is much more of a lounge than restaurant,…

Sushi happy hour at Current is an amazing deal. I've tried a few other places around DC and none of them have had as good quality fish and such impressive prices. They'll even add avocado at no extra charge which really…

Came by here for a few drinks with a friend.  Very nice place on the inside, had an upscale lounge feel to it, with lots of candles, lounge chairs, couches, etc.  The main floor is more of a dining area, with a bar in…

The weekend of New Years Eve my friend and I stayed the night at the Mayflower for her birthday (the 30th). It was absolutely the best experience ever. Our bellhop was very friendly and knowledgeable about the area. When…

The food here is comfort food with a slightly upscale flavor to it.  Big portions, lots of buttery goodness, filling and tasty.  You go to this restaurant and it is severely lacking in its decor. You feel like you are…

I think Cafe DuPont is one of the most underrated places in the city.  I too am guilty for frequently overlooking it when I am making reservations.  While it is in a hotel, it is not your typical hotel restaurant. The…

I went here for dinner about a week ago, so this review is based only on the food and dinning experience, not the music or performance itself.   We started off with a fried sweet banana, which was incredibly good. I…
