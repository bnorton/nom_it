So somewhere in a strip mall that looks like the little middle east in Arlington is this hookah bar with a fantastic dj. Sitting in this smokey tiny cafe, watching people smoke their shisha and play backgammon, it…

I've tried the crêpe on the first floor before so on a chilly Saturday night when I was in need of some hot, fried food I went upstairs. Georgetown Wing Co. is basically a small bar with an extensive menu. My friend…

Burgers remind me of In-N-Out back home!  They have great shakes! Try them to maintain your high-caloric diet.  Fries are amazing--crinkle cut extra crispy!

Disclaimer: The service is European. You'll get a glass of water and long waits in between visits, so don't come starving and bring good company to keep you occupied.  Now, the churros are amazing. Worth the wait.

It's not often you find a little cafe in DC with a full vegan menu, but that's what B Cafe is. Sure, they serve meat, too, but vegan "chicken" curry? You can't satisfy your urges for meat on a holy Friday anywhere else…

It doesn't satisfy my "real pizza" craving, but it's a solid choice for late night delivery and last minute "I want something saucy, cheesy, and fast".  Delivery is usually dependable, even in the wee hours. My favorites…
