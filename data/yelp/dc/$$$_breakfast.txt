After years of intending to do so, I finally made it to Cashion's Eat Place.  Husband and I headed over on an unusually balmy November morning for brunch -- I'd actually call it "blunch" instead, since the joint doesn't…

If you have read my review of The Kennedy Center, this may surprise you, hopefully pleasantly..... because, SURPRISE!  The Rooftop Terrace is actually quite good.  Sure, sure, the big open seating area sort of feels like…

Honestly I am surprised this place isn't jam packed. Went out with a couple of friends who purchased a deal from SalesVote to Puro. We sat on the back patio. It was an awesome space, reminded me of a European lounge. I…

The Ritz Carlton Washington DC has made me a fan for life. I've stayed here about 8 nights now and will absolutely be returning.  The building itself is rather non-descript and easy to miss, especially given the maze of…

The Four Seasons puts on an EXCELLENT breakfast and I definitely recommend checking it out.  I have had some lousy breakfasts at even the finest establishments, almost treated as if it were an afterthought, but this is…

My boyfriend & I were immediately greeted and treated like royalty. The staff was beyond gracious.   The hotels decor brings you back in time. Such a rich feel without the stuffiness of a 5 star mega hotel. The location…

The Washington Marriott was a nice hotel, unfortunately the things that made it so were characteristic of the Marriott brand in general and not this specific location. The huge, comfortable bed, supportive chair and…

I came here for a social networking alumni event organized by my alma mater. It sounded like it was going to be one of DC's newest, ultra-chic, uber-hip, trendy nighclub. As the name could almost imply, I was…

I had to cancel my reservation at Obelisk because my work party grew to more than six folks...ten to be exact.  Roberts Restaurant was able to accommodate us with no problem.  I read the reviews and was a little…
