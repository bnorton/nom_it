Came for lunch today, I would give this particular lunch 4.5 stars.  Service was not quite as perfect as usual and food had a couple of flaws but still an amazing experience (as usual)!    So my husband ordered the…

Stay away! Then I will definitely get a seat. I've been here twice, yesterday and last Thursday. Being a first timer, I felt I had to redo it all over again now that I know the etiquette.    No cell phone use inside…

We went here on New Year's Eve for the prix fixe dinner, and let me tell you, I'm still thinking about that meal a week later. And the cocktails, oh the cocktails. Amazing.   We weren't really sure where the door was at…

Big fun!. We were a group of 8 and certainly the ethnic minority here. However we were made to feel very welcome and our waiter (Mel) and the owner (Al) were exceptionally friendly and we were very well taken care of.…

Came here after dinner for drinks and dessert last Friday with some girlfriends. The drinks were very strong and on the pricey-er side, but that was expected so no shock there.   The gals wanted a little snack, but my…

Another one of those places that I kept walking by on my way from here to there and back again, but I felt like I needed an occasion of sorts to actually open the door and enjoy.  Sadly that opportunity arose when I lost…

Wow.  Impressive!  Posh!  Where are we--Miami?!  Vegas?!  You go here for the scene.  When I went it was the highlight of a bachelorette party.  Not a penis-straw bachelorette party, but a Sex and the City sort of…

It's a girls night my girlfriends are still talking about.  We arrived around 8:30pm, checked our coats at the door and were able to snag seats at the bar.  The bartenders were amazing, part of the reason my gf's still…

This is one of the best business lunch places I have found in the Loop. I have gone to just about every other place within a .5 mile radius of the CBOT and this is one of my favorites.   I highly recommend the crab cake…

The food ran the gamut from being perfectly fine but underwhelming (cumbersome hamachi special, 2x fried chicken) to being seriously epic (porkbelly).  Their shōch cocktail was super delicious and appropriately…

We were staying at the Wit Hotel this weekend and went up to the Roof on Friday night. We didn't get there till about 10:30 and it was already packed. So might want to leave earlier to get a seat.  They do charge a cover…

I had a waffle. It was hot. I topped it with ice cream. It was cold. Lots of hot fudge-y goodness. Mmmm.  I'm pretty sure I left in a sugar-coma on the verge of diabetes.  That being said, I liked it (yeah, more liked…
