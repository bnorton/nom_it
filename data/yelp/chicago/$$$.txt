Beware: This rating is strictly on the venue not on the restaurant's food.  I attended a Halloween party here a couple of Saturdays ago. The party was packed but the place is spacious enough that it was enough room to…

I first have to say that I find it hilarious that someone rated this place based on who actually spoke Italian. I think it is possible that a genuine Italian restaurant in the US can hire employees that only speak…

Riva surprisingly blew me away.  I was not sure what to think about dining at Navy Pier. It is a bit of a fun house atmosphere at the Pier.    We had tickets to see "The Follies"  so we decide to grab dinner at Riva's.…

Prime ++ meats. I had the lamb chops and they were cooked perfectly. I'm not fond of gamey lamb, and this was not at all gamey. I suspect it is fresh, never frozen. The side dishes are very large, so one is plenty for…

I'm going to be honest...I only gave this place three stars, because it attracts very attractive, professional men!   Okay, now that I've given you my disclosure let me be completely honest. I sat by the bar and…

Republic Pan Asia is also managed and owned by the owners of Rise on Southport. I like Republic for a number of reasons.   To begin with, the atmosphere at this place is great for going on a date. The outdoor seating…

This is more upscale than I thought. It sounded like a sports bar/brewpub kind of place but it is a high-end place with forty dollar steaks and overpriced RB beers.  The food is good but not amazing and the specials tend…

Just like old times. It has been sixteen years since I last ate here and it didn't disappoint. Someone at the table I was with ordered the shogun meal and the food did not stop.   Yeah, it is typical teppan-yaki food,…

Friday night dinner for four. We walked in with three bottles of wine, ready for our two hour dining experience, knowing we would all order Gaetapas.   Allow me to wax poetic. Please forgive me for not breaking down each…

It was a dark and stormy night . . . And it was when I wandered into this newly re-purposed retail space. Too lazy to cook a meal of my own, I walked a few blocks to discover the new place. I wanted basic comfort food,…
