Hell yeah.   I'm tempted to stop there. But just a little more.   If this is a little fancy pants for you (as it was for us) but you are considering it as a special treat, yet you are agonizing over whether it will be…

Came here on a whim on a weeknight and was seated in the dining area in 5 minutes.  There's a beautiful large window opening onto a private garden with gorgeous lighting that really set the scene.  It's not too loud, and…

If you are a fan of food, especially locally sourced food, you have to credit Chez Panisse founder Alice Waters with starting the movement. Back in the 70's Waters opened the downstairs part of Chez Panisse using local…

I came here on a...Friday night? Or maybe it was Saturday. Either way, there was a very long wait but the waitress told us that we could immediately be seated in the back "bar" area...so we chose that.  Walking past all…

Still a solid choice - just keep in mind the *Happiest Hour* is from 9-later, when the list of favorites in my old review is in action at great prices!    The 5-7 Happy Hour is okay, with only two lonely items; $5…

In dressed-down Berkeley, places like FIVE are few and far between. I'm a sucker for upscale-modern so I was pretty much sold on the atmosphere alone. Invited by a friend who I'm pretty sure was more interested in the…

Holy goat balls! No, literally...the goat meatballs with orange cauliflower puree  are celestial. And yet, totally not the point of this review...  Carnivorous cravings aside, Revival's cocktail repertoire is a prime…

This Michelin-rated and Zagat-reviewed restaurant really sets itself apart from many restaurants in DT Berkeley. Although not quite all French, as this restaurant serves pasta (http://www.yelp.com/bi...) and 1 "Asian"…

Wow.  Not only are they open after 10:00 - but the food, ambiance, host, and (especially) the service was superb.  We stopped in after the Portishead concert at the Greek.  This San Franciscan is used to having no…

It took me almost a year to get back to Zatar after our disappointing Valentine's date.  However, when my birthday came around, I decided to give it another try.    My neighbor, who knew the owners (chef and server…

Sadly, now closed, this market was all we had in this part of town in the way of a decent grocery store. Thanks to all the haters and financial problems of the grocer, now it's gone. I don't own a car and need to…
