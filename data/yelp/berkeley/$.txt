When its 1:30 am during finals week, you're only running on three hours of sleep and a sandwich you had twelve hours ago, you'll  be thankful Pancho's exists. I think the only other places open around that time are Top…

I'm sorry this place has such bad reviews.  It sounds like that is mostly about the service.  I used a Trubates coupon and they were kind enough to let me use it for take out instead of just dining in.  So all I got was…
